# 📧 Smart Email Classification System

The **Smart Email Classification System** is a Machine Learning–based application that automatically classifies emails into meaningful categories such as **Spam**, **Important**, **Promotions**, or **Work-related**.  
It helps users and organizations manage large volumes of emails efficiently by prioritizing what truly matters.

This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to prediction.
